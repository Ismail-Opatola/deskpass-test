4. Systems like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are the end result of years and years of effort spent slowly abstracting server resources from being "a single physical machine your app is running on" to "a distributed pool of generic resources any app can run on."

Will container management systems such as Kubernetes still be used, or will there be another layer of abstraction used?
